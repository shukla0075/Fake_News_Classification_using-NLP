# Fake_News_Classification_using-NLP
This repository contains code for classifying news articles as either real or fake using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can automatically detect misleading or false information in news articles.

Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of a collection of news articles labeled as real or fake. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.

Preprocessing

The preprocessing steps include tokenization, stop word removal, stemming or lemmatization, and vectorization of text data. These steps are essential for preparing the textual data for input into machine learning models.

Feature Engineering

Various features are extracted from the preprocessed text data to represent the articles in a format suitable for machine learning algorithms. These features may include word frequency counts, TF-IDF scores, n-grams, or word embeddings.

Model Training

Several machine learning models are trained using the preprocessed and feature-engineered data. These models may include traditional algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), as well as more advanced techniques like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers.

Model Evaluation

The trained models are evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the test dataset. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation may be employed to ensure the robustness of the models.

Usage

To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies.
Run the preprocessing scripts to prepare the data.
Train the machine learning models using the prepared data.
Evaluate the trained models using the test dataset.
Fine-tune the models or experiment with different algorithms to improve performance if necessary.
Results

The results of the model evaluation, including accuracy and other performance metrics, will be reported in the repository. Visualizations such as confusion matrices or ROC curves may also be included to provide insights into the model's behavior.

Future Work

Future work may involve exploring more advanced NLP techniques, experimenting with different architectures of neural networks, incorporating external knowledge sources, or deploying the model in real-world applications such as browser extensions or social media platforms to combat the spread of fake news.
